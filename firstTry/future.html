    <h1>Hopes for my future.</h1>
    <p>I'm excited to tackle new challenges at gSchool and to acquire the skills and knowledge needed to be an effective web developer.  After gSchool I hope to find a fast paced startup in order to learn and thrive in a dynamic environment.  After realizing that my previous job was not satisfying or challenging me, I am thrilled to finally be starting gSchool.</p>
